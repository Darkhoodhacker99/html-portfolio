<h1>About Web Pages</h1>
<p>A web page (or webpage) is a document on the Web that is accessed in a web browser. A website typically consists of many web pages 
  linked together under a common domain name. The term "web page" is thus a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.</p>

<p>Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the 
  browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the 
  user's screen. If the user clicks or taps a link, the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the 
  current website or a different one. The browser has features, such as the address bar, that indicate which page is displayed.</p>

<p>A web page is a structured document. The core element is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This specifies 
  the content of the page, including images and video. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of the page. CSS rules 
  can be in separate text files or embedded within the HTML file. The vast majority of pages have JavaScript programs, enabling a wide 
  range of behavior. The newer WebAssembly language can also be used as a supplement. The most sophisticated web pages, known as web 
  apps, combine these elements in a complex manner.</p>

<p>From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic. Static pages are 
  retrieved from the web server's file system without any modification, while dynamic pages must be created by the server on the fly,
  typically reading from a database to fill out a template, before being sent to the user's browser. An example of a dynamic page is 
  a search engine results page.</p>
